title: Getting data

First things first. Need to get some data to work with. For the US, that means going to St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank and their economic database called FRED <http://https://fred.stlouisfed.org/>.

There you have an option to set up your account and obtain API key, which will enable you to fetch data from the FRED in R directly.
