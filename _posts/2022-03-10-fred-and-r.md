title: Getting data in R from FRED
---

First things first. Need to get some data to work with. For the US, that generally means going to St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank and their economic database called FRED <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/>.

There we have an option to set up your account and obtain API key, which will enable you to fetch data from the FRED in R directly. <https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikey>

To take advatage of this we need to use a package in R called fredr. A package is the most basic way and share code, data or tests are shared in R. PAckages can be obtained from CRAN or **C**omprehenvsive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork. 

This code sets up the package and loads it in our R session to be used. 
```
#install fredr package from CRAN
install.packages("fredr")
#load package
library(fredr)
```
